# Online-Fraud-Detection-Using-Smote-Analysis-Machine-Learning
SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) helps improve online fraud detection by balancing imbalanced datasets. It generates synthetic examples of rare fraudulent transactions, allowing models to better recognize and learn fraud patterns. This boosts detection accuracy and reduces bias toward non-fraudulent cases.
